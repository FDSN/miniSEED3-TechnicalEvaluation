# Technical Evaluation for the next generation of miniSEED

This GitHub repository, and especially its issues, will be used for step 2 of the design of the next generation miniSEED format. The three stages, [previously identified](http://www.fdsn.org/message-center/thread/514/#m-882) of its design are:

* **Step 1**: Community agreement on the basic requirements for the next generation miniSEED.
* **Step 2**: Technical evaluation of these requirements.
* **Step 3**: Technical discussion targeting selection of the best solution.

**The goal of step 2 is to evaluate the [requirements agreed on in stage 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ymAe9v1rUuucpY7ai5ilKsD7V1ejwt6GxQQmJ5IevDI/edit?ts=5a2a921c#) and** 
1. confirm that each requirement is technically feasible and
1. discuss technical approaches for each requirement, voting to identify the consensus for preference of approach.

**Multiple possible technical solutions for some requirements are expected. The outcome of this stage will be a clear yes/no for acccepting each requirement as technically feasible and identification of a consensus approach for each.  Combining the results of this stage to form full implementation specification proposals for step 3 may be done by any interested parties.**

### Procedure and Timeline

1. Discussion will start right now and will be moderated by [@krischer](https://github.com/krischer/). Anyone is invited to join. A separate issue is available for each discussion point.

2. **Discussion on each issue is expected to be finished by January 29th and voting will end January 31st**. The votes will be tallied up by [@krischer](https://github.com/krischer/) on February 1st. Please register to vote (and state which institution you represent) in [#1](/../../issues/1). You can vote either by reacting with :+1: (YES) or :-1: (NO) to the head post in an issue or by explicitly stating your support for/contra in a comment in an issue. A transparent vote summary for each issue (including institutions) will be provided by [@krischer](https://github.com/krischer/) after voting has concluded. [@krischer](https://github.com/krischer/) will not vote but break a tie, if necessary.

## Technical Evaluation

The discussion will be broken up in a number of issues:

### Administrative Issues:

* **[#1](/../../issues/1):** Register to vote by posting to this issue.
* **[#2](/../../issues/2):** Discuss anything related to this readme here.
* **[#3](/../../issues/3):** Misc discussions. Please don't open arbitrary new issues but discuss generic things here. A new issue will be opened in case it is deemed necessary.
* **[#26](/../../issues/26):** Discussion about the name of the new format.

### Basic Requirements:

* **[#4](/../../issues/4):** A new method of identifying a time series.
* **[#5](/../../issues/5):** The new format must be fully self-defining.
* **[#6](/../../issues/6):** Specify absolute time, including leap seconds, using an existing standard.
* **[#7](/../../issues/7):** Conversion tools must perform conversion from miniSEED 2 *without* loss of important information.
* **[#8](/../../issues/8):** Joint evolution of StationXML.
* **[#9](/../../issues/9):** Proper documentation, best practices.

### Additional Requirements:

* **[#10](/../../issues/10):** Identification of non-raw, derived data.
* **[#11](/../../issues/11):** New data payload encoding types (general, opaque).
* **[#12](/../../issues/12):** Include a CRC (cyclic redundancy check) of the complete record.
* **[#13](/../../issues/13):** Include both a format and a data/publication version number.
* **[#14](/../../issues/14):** Allow addition of arbitrary headers by equipment manufacturers, operators, etc. without the need for authorization or approval by the FDSN.
* **[#15](/../../issues/15):** Support variable length records for efficiency and flexibility (e.g. real time streaming with lower latency).
* **[#16](/../../issues/16):** Provide nanosecond-timing resolution in both record start time and sample rate/period.
* **[#17](/../../issues/17):** Provide support for high sampling rates.
* Simplification/reorganization of miniSEED:
	* **[#18](/../../issues/18):** Move key, selected blockette details (e.g. actual sample rate, data payload encoding) into fixed header.
	* **[#19](/../../issues/19):** Fix byte order (e.g. little endian) of binary portions of header; define byte order of payload via encoding values.
	* **[#20](/../../issues/20):** Remove blockette support.
	* **[#21](/../../issues/21):** Simplify and improve record start time.
	* **[#22](/../../issues/22):** Eliminate time correction field as a required, always-present field and retain as an optional field present when needed.
	* **[#23](/../../issues/23):** Combine and drop unused / underspecified bit flags.
	* **[#24](/../../issues/24):** Eliminate sequence number as a required, always-present field and retain as an optional field present when needed.
* **[#25](/../../issues/25):** Alongside with the new format, a protocol for (near) real time data exchange needs to be specified.

### Issues Discussing the Expansion and Conventions of the FDSN Identifiers

Assuming the FDSN identifiers are used (discuss in **[#4](/../../issues/4)**) how should they be expanded and what conventions should be applied? Limitations in the current identifiers are becoming a pressing issues and are a (or the) main motivator for discussing a new data format in the first place.

* **[#27](/../../issues/27):** Expansion and convention of the network code
* **[#28](/../../issues/28):** Expansion of the station code
* **[#29](/../../issues/29):** Expansion and convention of the location code
* **[#30](/../../issues/30):** Expansion and convention of the channel code
